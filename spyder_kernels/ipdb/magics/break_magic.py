        current file.  With a function name, set a break at the first
        executable line of that function.  If a second argument is
        present, it is a string specifying an expression which must
        evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored.

        The line number may be prefixed with a filename and a colon,
        to specify a breakpoint in another file (probably one that
        hasn't been loaded yet).  The file is searched for on
        sys.path; the .py suffix may be omitted.
